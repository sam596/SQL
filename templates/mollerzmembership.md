##### Description

> Bronze: A result in every event. (Because this is an all-rounder thing)
> 
> Then you get a ranking stage each time you complete any one of the following:
> - Averages in all sighted speedsolve events (Not BLD/FMC)
> - Means in FMC/BLD
> - WC Podium
> - WR
> - Win all events
>
> Ranking stages go
> Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Opal -> Diamond
>
> This reduces region bias with CR/NR and also makes Gold obtainable only on personal talent. Gold is considered the pinnacle of a lot of things (Olympics, World Championships at sports, etc.) but getting past this point requires that bit extra to be on the next level.
